# Particle-Mesh-Home

This is an overview of the Particle Mesh network running at my home.  Also included is a Photon-powered weather station and a Boron-powered Alert system for my elderly mother whom we care for.  (A DIY alternative to LifeAlert.)
The Mesh network is made up of a Particle Argon located centrally in the home and surrounding Xenon endpoints.  Currently there are two - one connected in the garage to the door opener and one in the den connected to a light.  Using Blynk on a smartphone the garage can be opened and closed and the light in the den can be turned on and off.  The light is also on a Blynk timer to turn on and off automativally.

All of this is open-source code and hardware so feel free use it for your own project. ;)

Images are located in the Particle Home Mesh folder.  There is a 3d print model of a wall mount that holds the Particle Argon.  It can be used for the Boron, or Xenon, or any of the Adafruit Feather boards.  I used one of the Featherwing Proto Boards and hot-glued it to the wall mount.  The Argon plugs into it.  I prefer to use hot-glue instead of screws.  It's plenty strong but also easy to remove without any damage.
